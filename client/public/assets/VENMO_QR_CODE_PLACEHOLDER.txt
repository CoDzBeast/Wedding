Venmo QR Code Placeholder

This is a placeholder note for the Venmo QR code image.
To implement this feature:

1. Generate a QR code for your Venmo account
2. Save it as "venmo-qr.png" in this directory
3. Replace "@YourVenmoName" in the registry-section.tsx component with your actual Venmo handle

The image should be sized appropriately for mobile and desktop viewing (recommended size: 200x200 pixels).
