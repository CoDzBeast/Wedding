PayPal and CashApp QR Code Placeholders

This file serves as a reminder to add the actual PayPal and CashApp QR code images:

1. Generate QR codes for your PayPal and CashApp accounts
2. Save them as:
   - paypal-qr.png
   - cashapp-qr.png
3. Place them in this same directory (client/public/assets/)
4. Update the CashApp username in the registry-section.tsx component by replacing "$YourCashTag" with your actual CashApp tag

These images should be sized appropriately for mobile and desktop viewing (recommended size: 200x200 pixels).
