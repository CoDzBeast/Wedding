Design and build a single-page wedding website that feels deeply personal, cinematic, and handcrafted — inspired by thefutureharrisons.wedsites.com but with a completely original structure and tone.

The layout should use scroll-anchored sections with a fixed top toolbar for navigation.
Toolbar links: Home, Our Story, Wedding Details, Itinerary, Registry, Local Stays, and RSVP.

🕊️ Hero Section

Center the couple’s names in refined typography — think editorial, not digital.

Include a countdown timer to the wedding day that feels naturally integrated, like part of the typography — not a boxed widget.

Use a warm, cinematic background (soft neutral texture or lightly faded photo), setting the emotional tone.

Add a simple, heartfelt welcome line or date just beneath the countdown.

🌿 Our Story

Tell the couple’s journey as a narrative rather than bullet points — minimal design, intentional whitespace, subtle dividers or leaf-like flourishes.
The pacing should feel like reading a page from a love-letter or a slow pan in a film.

📍 Wedding Details

Clean, balanced layout for ceremony and reception information.
Include times, addresses, attire guidance, and a “Get Directions” link — all styled like refined printed text.
Avoid icons, boxes, or cards. Focus on typography and alignment.

🕰️ Itinerary

Display the wedding-day timeline as a seamless flow — either a vertical journey down the page or a soft horizontal scroll.
Each entry (e.g., 2 PM – Ceremony Begins, 5 PM – Dinner Served, 8 PM – Dancing Under the Lights) should appear in graceful rhythm with the page.
Keep motion subtle — soft fades or gentle slides on scroll.

🎁 Registry

Elegant, minimal layout that lists registry links with equal spacing and visual balance.
Each registry (e.g., Target, Amazon, Honeyfund) can appear as a stylized text button — no logos, no heavy graphics.
The goal: refined generosity, not retail noise.

🏡 Local Stays

Section for recommended hotels or accommodations near the venue.
Layout idea: a curated list with short descriptions and links to booking pages — styled like an editorial travel note, not a card grid.
Keep it elegant and welcoming: use location names, distances, and brief notes (e.g., “2 min walk from venue,” “Includes breakfast,” “Family-friendly”).

💌 RSVP

A clean, minimalist RSVP form — transparent inputs, soft fade-in on scroll, no boxes or outlines.
Subtle confirmation message after submission, matching the site’s tone.

✨ Overall Aesthetic

Color Palette: soft ivory, parchment, sage, olive, muted gold

Typography: modern serif (for body) + handwritten or script accent (for names and headers)

Motion: subtle parallax, gentle fades, slow scroll reveals — never over-animated

Feel: timeless, filmic, intimate — like a handcrafted invitation quietly coming alive.

Avoid all template clichés: no boxed cards, gradients, geometric backgrounds, floating shapes, or generic icons.
Every element should feel chosen, not generated.
